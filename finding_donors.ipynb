    "## Getting Started\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, you will employ several supervised algorithms of your choice to accurately model individuals' income using data collected from the 1994 U.S. Census. You will then choose the best candidate algorithm from preliminary results and further optimize this algorithm to best model the data. Your goal with this implementation is to construct a model that accurately predicts whether an individual makes more than $50,000. This sort of task can arise in a non-profit setting, where organizations survive on donations.  Understanding an individual's income can help a non-profit better understand how large of a donation to request, or whether or not they should reach out to begin with.  While it can be difficult to determine an individual's general income bracket directly from public sources, we can (as we will see) infer this value from other publically available features. \n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset for this project originates from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Census+Income). The datset was donated by Ron Kohavi and Barry Becker, after being published in the article _\"Scaling Up the Accuracy of Naive-Bayes Classifiers: A Decision-Tree Hybrid\"_. You can find the article by Ron Kohavi [online](https://www.aaai.org/Papers/KDD/1996/KDD96-033.pdf). The data we investigate here consists of small changes to the original dataset, such as removing the `'fnlwgt'` feature and records with missing or ill-formatted entries."

    "For highly-skewed feature distributions such as `'capital-gain'` and `'capital-loss'`, it is common practice to apply a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_transformation_(statistics)\">logarithmic transformation</a> on the data so that the very large and very small values do not negatively affect the performance of a learning algorithm. Using a logarithmic transformation significantly reduces the range of values caused by outliers. Care must be taken when applying this transformation however: The logarithm of `0` is undefined, so we must translate the values by a small amount above `0` to apply the the logarithm successfully.\n",

Applying a scaling to the data does not change the shape of each feature's distribution (such as `'capital-gain'` or `'capital-loss'` above); however, normalization ensures that each feature is treated equally when applying supervised learners. Note that once scaling is applied, observing the data in its raw form will no longer have the same original meaning, as exampled below.\n",
    "\n",
    "Run the code cell below to normalize each numerical feature. We will use [`sklearn.preprocessing.MinMaxScaler`](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.preprocessing.MinMaxScaler.html) for this."

    "From the table in **Exploring the Data** above, we can see there are several features for each record that are non-numeric. Typically, learning algorithms expect input to be numeric, which requires that non-numeric features (called *categorical variables*) be converted. One popular way to convert categorical variables is by using the **one-hot encoding** scheme. One-hot encoding creates a _\"dummy\"_ variable for each possible category of each non-numeric feature. For example, assume `someFeature` has three possible entries: `A`, `B`, or `C`. We then encode this feature into `someFeature_A`, `someFeature_B` and `someFeature_C`.\n",

    "| 2 |  A  |  | 1 | 0 | 0 |\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, as with the non-numeric features, we need to convert the non-numeric target label, `'income'` to numerical values for the learning algorithm to work. Since there are only two possible categories for this label (\"<=50K\" and \">50K\"), we can avoid using one-hot encoding and simply encode these two categories as `0` and `1`, respectively. In code cell below, you will need to implement the following:\n",
    " - Use [`pandas.get_dummies()`](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.get_dummies.html?highlight=get_dummies#pandas.get_dummies) to perform one-hot encoding on the `'features_log_minmax_transform'` data.\n",

    "### Metrics and the Naive Predictor\n",
    "*CharityML*, equipped with their research, knows individuals that make more than \\$50,000 are most likely to donate to their charity. Because of this, *CharityML* is particularly interested in predicting who makes more than \\$50,000 accurately. It would seem that using **accuracy** as a metric for evaluating a particular model's performace would be appropriate. Additionally, identifying someone that *does not* make more than \\$50,000 as someone who does would be detrimental to *CharityML*, since they are looking to find individuals willing to donate. Therefore, a model's ability to precisely predict those that make more than \\$50,000 is *more important* than the model's ability to **recall** those individuals. We can use **F-beta score** as a metric that considers both precision and recall:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ F_{\\beta} = (1 + \\beta^2) \\cdot \\frac{precision \\cdot recall}{\\left( \\beta^2 \\cdot precision \\right) + recall} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, when $\\beta = 0.5$, more emphasis is placed on precision. This is called the **F$_{0.5}$ score** (or F-score for simplicity).\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at the distribution of classes (those who make at most \\$50,000, and those who make more), it's clear most individuals do not make more than \\$50,000. This can greatly affect **accuracy**, since we could simply say *\"this person does not make more than \\$50,000\"* and generally be right, without ever looking at the data! Making such a statement would be called **naive**, since we have not considered any information to substantiate the claim. It is always important to consider the *naive prediction* for your data, to help establish a benchmark for whether a model is performing well. That been said, using that prediction would be pointless: If we predicted all people made less than \\$50,000, *CharityML* would identify no one as donors. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Note: Recap of accuracy, precision, recall\n",
    "\n",
    "** Accuracy ** measures how often the classifier makes the correct prediction. It’s the ratio of the number of correct predictions to the total number of predictions (the number of test data points).\n",
    "\n",
    "** Precision ** tells us what proportion of messages we classified as spam, actually were spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all positives(all words classified as spam, irrespective of whether that was the correct classificatio), in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Positives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "** Recall(sensitivity)** tells us what proportion of messages that actually were spam were classified by us as spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all the words that were actually spam, in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Negatives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "For classification problems that are skewed in their classification distributions like in our case, for example if we had a 100 text messages and only 2 were spam and the rest 98 weren't, accuracy by itself is not a very good metric. We could classify 90 messages as not spam(including the 2 that were spam but we classify them as not spam, hence they would be false negatives) and 10 as spam(all 10 false positives) and still get a reasonably good accuracy score. For such cases, precision and recall come in very handy. These two metrics can be combined to get the F1 score, which is weighted average(harmonic mean) of the precision and recall scores. This score can range from 0 to 1, with 1 being the best possible F1 score(we take the harmonic mean as we are dealing with ratios)."

    "Decision Trees :\n",
    "Decision Trees will be good candidate for credit scoring, crime risk, medical diagnosis.\n",
    "\n",
    "The strengths of decision tree are,\n",
    "Easy to understand and interpret :-\n",
    "     At each node, we are able to see exactly what decision our model is making. In practice we’ll be able to fully understand where our accuracies and errors are coming from, what type of data the model would do well with, and how the output is influenced by the values of the features. Scikit learn’s visualisation tool is a fantastic option for visualising and understanding decision trees.\n",
    "     \n",
    "Require very little data preparation:- \n",
    "        Many ML models may require heavy data pre-processing such as normalization and may require complex regularisation schemes. Decision trees on the other hand work quite well out of the box after tweaking a few of the parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "The cost of using the tree for inference is logarithmic in the number of data points used to train the tree. \n",
    "\n",
    "The weakness of decision tree are,\n",
    "\n",
    "Overfitting is quite common with decision trees simply due to the nature of their training. It’s often recommended to perform some type of dimensionality reduction such as PCA so that the tree doesn’t have to learn splits on so many features.\n",
    "For similar reasons as the case of overfitting, decision trees are also vulnerable to becoming biased to the classes that have a majority in the dataset. It’s always a good idea to do some kind of class balancing such as class weights, sampling, or a specialised loss function.\n",
    "\n",
    "Decision tree makes a good candidate for this problem since we have only 13 features and our model has to be a classification.\n",
    "\n",
    "Logistic Regression :\n",
    "Logistic Regression will be good cadidate for image classifier, Spam detection, handwriting recognition. \n",
    "\n",
    "The strengths of Logistic Regression are,\n",
    "One of the simplest machine learning algorithms yet provides great efficiency.\n",
    "Variance is low.\n",
    "It can also used for feature extraction\n",
    "Logistic models can be updated easily with new data using stochastic gradient descent.\n",
    "\n",
    "The weakness of Logistic Regression are,\n",
    "Doesn’t handle large number of categorical variables well.\n",
    "It requires transformation of non-linear features.\n",
    "They are not flexible enough to naturally capture more complex relationships.\n",
    "\n",
    "Logistic Regression makes a good candidate for this problem since this problem falls into classification category and its one of the simplest method that provides great efficiency. Since we will be using this model for new data we need to variance to be low inorder for a better predicion on unseen data.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "AdaBoost :\n",
    "\n",
    "Adaboost is an ensemble classifier that trains many singlelearners and select a collection (ensemble) of hypotheses and combine their predictions. It will be good candidate for face detection.\n",
    "\n",
    "The strengths of AdaBoost are,\n",
    "\n",
    "Can use differant learning algorithms such as SVM, KNN, etc and combine the learning to make better predictions.\n",
    "Use subset of data to train the weak learners and combine them for better prediction.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Weakness of AdaBoost are,\n",
    "\n",
    "Underfitting problem, AdaBoost can generate a decisionboundary without adding more complexity to the model, because theclassiﬁers are not well trained, i.e., weak learner.\n",
    "Data which has noise or outliers may lead to Overfitting problem.This is because AdaBoost gives high weights for noisy and outliers.\n",

    "Hello, <br> We finally have a model to predict individuals that make more than $50,000, The model we have is called Adaboost, it is one of the Ensemble model. AdaBoost aim is to combine differant weak learners or classifiers together to improve the classifiation performance. We have trained the model with 13 features,\n",

    "The features will be used to train the model from the data we collected,we also have income column which states if the individual is making more than or less than $50,000. We totally had 36177 records training data with all the necessary preprocessing steps. the Adaboost model will use this training data and learn based on what conditions the individuals are making more than 50,000. Once the model is trained it was tested with the testing data to make predictions to compare the results of the model. <br> Once the model was trained we got an accuracy of 86% and a Fbeta-score of 0.7246. The F-beta score is the weighted harmonic mean of precision and recall. The score lies in the range [0,1] with 1 being ideal and 0 being the worst. The beta value is the weight given to precision vs recall in the combined score. beta=0 considers only precision, as beta increases, more weight is given to recall with beta > 1 favoring recall over precision. In our case we are looking for a Balanced between precision and recall.\n",

    "<font color=blue>  The term ‘Boosting’ refers to a family of algorithms which converts weak learner to strong learners.\n",
    "    \n",
    " Let’s understand this definition in detail by solving a problem of spam email identification:\n",
    "\n",
    "How would you classify an email as SPAM or not? Like everyone else, our initial approach would be to identify ‘spam’ and ‘not spam’ emails using following criteria. If:\n",
    "\n",
    "Email has only one image file (promotional image), It’s a SPAM\n",
    "Email has only link(s), It’s a SPAM\n",
    "Email body consist of sentence like “You won a prize money of $ xxxxxx”, It’s a SPAM\n",
    "Email from our official domain “Analyticsvidhya.com” , Not a SPAM\n",
    "Email from known source, Not a SPAM\n",
    "Above, we’ve defined multiple rules to classify an email into ‘spam’ or ‘not spam’. But, do you think these rules individually are strong enough to successfully classify an email? No.\n",
    "\n",
    "Individually, these rules are not powerful enough to classify an email into ‘spam’ or ‘not spam’. Therefore, these rules are called as weak learner.\n",
    "\n",
    "To convert weak learner to strong learner, we’ll combine the prediction of each weak learner using methods like:\n",
    "•   Using average/ weighted average\n",
    "•   Considering prediction has higher vote\n",
    "\n",
    "For example:  Above, we have defined 5 weak learners. Out of these 5, 3 are voted as ‘SPAM’ and 2 are voted as ‘Not a SPAM’. In this case, by default, we’ll consider an email as SPAM because we have higher(3) vote for ‘SPAM’.\n",
    "\n",
    "For choosing the right distribution, here are the following steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "Step 1:  The base learner takes all the distributions and assign equal weight or attention to each observation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Step 2: If there is any prediction error caused by first base learning algorithm, then we pay higher attention to observations having prediction error. Then, we apply the next base learning algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "Step 3: Iterate Step 2 till the limit of base learning algorithm is reached or higher accuracy is achieved.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, it combines the outputs from weak learner and creates  a strong learner which eventually improves the prediction power of the model. Boosting pays higher focus on examples which are mis-classiﬁed or have higher errors by preceding weak rules.\n",
    "    \n",
    "<img src = \"boost.png\">\n",

    "- Import [`sklearn.grid_search.GridSearchCV`](http://scikit-learn.org/0.17/modules/generated/sklearn.grid_search.GridSearchCV.html) and [`sklearn.metrics.make_scorer`](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.metrics.make_scorer.html).\n",
    "- Initialize the classifier you've chosen and store it in `clf`.\n",
    " - Set a `random_state` if one is available to the same state you set before.\n",
    "- Create a dictionary of parameters you wish to tune for the chosen model.\n",
    " - Example: `parameters = {'parameter' : [list of values]}`.\n",
    " - **Note:** Avoid tuning the `max_features` parameter of your learner if that parameter is available!\n",
    "- Use `make_scorer` to create an `fbeta_score` scoring object (with $\\beta = 0.5$).\n",
    "- Perform grid search on the classifier `clf` using the `'scorer'`, and store it in `grid_obj`.\n",

    "There were only two features Age & capital gain selected by model from what I thought was important.<br> Age and Capital gain is certain because people who just stated working make less money than the one who is well established in their career. And also if someone is making Capital gain would be having investment apart from their regular salary or running business.\n",
    "\n",
    "The other features that I didnt guess are Capital loss, hours per week and education. <br> Capital loss could be highly correlated because the less the loss (or zero amount) would mean the individual is making more profit. The Cumulative feature weight is not so great, hence we can substitute a better feature instead of this one. \n",
    "Hours per week would also be an important feature since the more hours the individual work, the more money they will make.\n",
    "Education was also given by the model which I think highly correlated with occupation which was my guess. The type of education decides the profession of an individual. so I beleive this is an important feature correctly identified by the model. "

    "How does a model perform if we only use a subset of all the available features in the data? With less features required to train, the expectation is that training and prediction time is much lower — at the cost of performance metrics. From the visualization above, we see that the top five most important features contribute more than half of the importance of **all** features present in the data. This hints that we can attempt to *reduce the feature space* and simplify the information required for the model to learn. The code cell below will use the same optimized model you found earlier, and train it on the same training set *with only the top five important features*. "
